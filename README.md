# Libft - @42Born2Code

## What's the goal of Libft?

Libft should re-create some of the standard C library functions.

## Why would you do this?

At 42 we are not allowed to use every C funtion from the standard library for our later projects, so we must create out own. So the first project is to create this library.
The library should be error and leak free, because we use it in most other projects.

### What did i learn from it?

- Memory handling.
- Data types
- String/Char array handling
- Makefiles
- Pointer
- Allocating Memory / Freeing Memory
- Data structures
- Linked lists
- Creating an own archive/library

## What's inside?

### Convert functions

Example: ft_itoa, ft_atoi

### Check function

Example: ft_isalnum, ft_isalpha

### Memory functions

Example: ft_calloc, ft_memcpy

### String functions

Example: ft_strlcat, ft_strlcpy

### Linked list functions
